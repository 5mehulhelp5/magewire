# Magewire - Pagination Component
> Please keep in mind that Magewire is currently in a Beta-phase. Therefore not all architectural choices are set in
> concrete. So make sure you are aware of the risks of building on top of the platform in it's current state.

## Concept
Pagination in its current state is designed to give developers complete freedom on how data is retrieved and served.
A number of obligations are established through the Pagination interface. Its possible there will be an extension of
this concept in the future that is the roughest of the implementation, taking into account e.g. the use of repositories.
